# Website Challenge

### We have a problem!

An awesome new startup company need to implement a way to allow their employees to log into the admin website, but they have no idea how to do it, so they hire one of the best front-end developers in the tech industry to solve this challenge, are you ready?
### The solution

Develop a functional Login page with email and password fields, the page design must follow mobile first approach; the email field must accept just valid email addresses and the password must be 8 characters length that must contain at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number and 1 special character within `!@#$%^&*_-~.,;:+=`, when the form is submitted, the page must show a generated Json Web Token. Finally, as the user types in the form fields, the page should 
display a message indicating whether the value entered is valid or not accordingly to the previous validations.
